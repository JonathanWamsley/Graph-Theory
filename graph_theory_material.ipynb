    "# Representing a graph\n",

    "- Two most common abstract representations of graphs are:\n",
    "    - adjacency matrix\n",
    "    - adjacency list\n",
    "        - is really a mapping that can be represented in python by\n",
    "            - an object-orienged approach with a Python dict as its underlying data type\n",
    "            - or a plain dict directly\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "    - One of the easiest ways to implement a graph is to use a two-dimensional matrix\n",
    "    - in this matrix implementation, each of the rwos and columns represent a vertex in the graph\n",
    "    - the value that is stored in the cell at the intersection of row v and column w indicates if there is an edge from vertex v to vertex w\n",
    "    - when two verticies are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent\n",
    "    - a value in a cell represents the weight of the edge from vertex v to vertex w\n",
    "        - pros: simple\n",
    "        - cons: not an efficient way to store graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- The adjacency List\n",
    "    - A more space-efficient way to implement a sparesely connected graph\n",
    "    - we keep a master collection of all the verticies in the graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other verticies that it is connected to\n",
    "    - in the implementation, the vertex class uses a dictionary rather than a list as the master collection, where the dictionary keys are the vertcies, and the values are the weightd\n",
    "        - pros: that it allows us to compactly represent a sparse graph. The adjacency list also allows us to easily find all the links that are directly connected to a particular vertex\n",
    "        \n",
    "- An object-orinted approach\n",
    "    - using dictionaries, it is easy to implement the adjacency list in Python\n",
    "    - in this implementation we create two classes: Graph, which holds the master list of verticies, and Vertex, which will represent each vertex in the graph\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Each vertex uses a dictionary to keep track of the verticies to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge\n",
    "    - if we weren't concerned with edge weights, we could use a set in place of a dictionary\n",
    "    - this dictionary is called neighbors\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the code below the add_neighbor method is used to add a connection from the vertex to another\n",
    "- the get_connection method returns all the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the neighbors instance variable\n",
    "- the get_weight method returns the weight of the edge from this vertex to the vertex passed as a parameter\n",

    "It is even possible that a depth first search will create more than one tree. When the depth first search algorithm creates a group of trees we call this a depth first forest. As with the breadth first search our depth first search makes use of predecessor links to construct the tree. In addition, the depth first search will make use of two additional instance variable in the verte_ class. The new instance variables are the discovery and finish times. The discovery time tracks the number of steps in the algorithm before a verte_ is first encountered. The finish time is the number of steps in the algorithm before a verte_ is colored black. As we will see after looking at the algorithm, the discovery and finish time of the nodes provide some interesting propeties we can use in later algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for our depth first search is shown below. We use a set to maintain a recod of the nodes that have been visited as we recursively traverse through our sample graph. For each verte_, any neighboring vertices that have not yet been visited are traversed. This is much like our depth first traversal for our knight's tour solution, except that we do not need to keep track of the path taken to reach every vertex, allowing us to more simply use our visited set.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- many problems in graph theory can be represented using a grid\n",
    "- grids are a form of implicit graph because we can determine a node's neighbors based on our location within the grid\n",
    "\n",
    "- A common approach to solving graph theory problems on grids is to first convert the grid to a familiar format such as an adjaceny list\n",
